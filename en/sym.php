			SYM stands for Sanyang Motors of Taiwan. SYM is a household name in the Taiwanese scooter market and they have honed their 
			skills in production during their many years of close cooperation with Honda. Honda's obsession with quality control has 
			definitely transferred over to SYM. Today, the annual sales revenue of the company exceeds 1 Billion US dollars 
			and it produces more than 600,000 units of motorcycles and 20,000 automobiles per year. SYM currently employs more 
			than 2,400 people in its manufacturing plants.
		</p>
			(Remember, when we are talking about scooters, the Taiwanese stuff is "top-shelf" and must not be confused with Chinese products.)

		<h4>Ceramic Coating Cylinder</h4>
		<p>
		Ceramic Coating Cylinder is a high-tech product, which applies special compound-electroplating process to disperse 
		SiC ceramic particles uniformly distributing on the cylinder wall. SYM is the first company in Taiwan to make mass 
		production of motorcycle engine by utilizing SiC ceramic coating technique.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Ceramic Sic material can overcome the weakness of general ceramic materials, and in the meantime it possesses excellent
		properties of high hardness (wear resistance), heat resistance and etc., which can be the best candidate matching the requirements
		of the engine cylinder. However, general conventional electroplating techniques cannot disperse SiC ceramic particles on the cylinder
		wall due to the insulation and high weight. As a result, SYM have developed the special compound-electroplating process to disperse Ni
		particles and SiC particles on the cylinder wall together, which forms a particular cylinder with the compound-electroplating layer (Ni/SiC), and brings the quality to excellence. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Currently the quality control of mass production has already achieved to maintain the defective rate below 0.3%, so the ceramic coating cylinder with high quality 
		and appropriate price can therefore be produced.

		<h4>High-efficiency 4 Valve Engine</h4>
		<p>
		The 4 valve engine mechanism not only increase air intake but also considerably improve engine efficiency over the uneven 
		fuel concentration problem inherent in 2 valve engine combustion chambers to allow more complete combustion and better fuel economy,
		as well as to effectively reduce noise and exhaust pollution.

		<h4>EFI - Electric Fuel Injection System</h4>
		<p>
			EFI System is the technique as the same level as the current automobile engine. It controls air inflow / fuel injection ratio,
			fuel injection volume and injection timing through the computer programs and sends the mixed air and fuel most appropriately 
			into the engine through the nozzle spout, as well as to control the ignition angle to achieve the best performance and pollution
			management. Also because EFI system utilizes computer programs to control air inflow/ fuel injection ratio and fuel injection volume,
			it significantly enhances the horsepower and moreover to help improving pollution and fuel-saving in comparison with conventional
			carburettor automobiles.

		<h4>VIP</h4>
		<p>	
		Utilize negative pressure in the inlet pipe to control air inflow of V.I.P. and to the enhance horsepower of high engine speed 
		and the torsion of low engine speed. 
		The main purpose of Variable Inlet Process is to enhance the torsion of low engine speed, collocated with the high speed performance 
		of 4V engine, and to improve fuel efficiency.
		This system can provide the most appropriate air inflow/ fuel injection ratio based on different engine speed, so the engine performance
		can be further enhanced and the best fuel efficiency is achieved.
		</p>
		Technical Advantage:
		<p>
			Effectively improve the inflow efficiency of low speed up to around 50%, and furthermore to improve the performance.
			he combustion efficiency can lower down the fuel consumption. (average fuel consumption of VIP: 42km/L)
			Maintain the torsion on the summit: Torsion value is kept at 5000~7000 r.p.m.

		<h4>Throttle Position Sensor</h4>
		<p>	
		Throttle Position Sensor: the sensor located in the throttle position to detect throttle opening, and transmit the signal 
		to the ECU of CDI or EFI which can adjust the ignition angle in light of throttle opening in order to strengthen the performance 
		curve under different speeds.
		</p>
		<p>
		The advantage of this new-generation intelligent TPS is to immediately provide the throttle opening, synchronously verify 
		the engine speed, and smartly identify the engine load and ignition angle. The intelligent CDI ignition system composed of 
		implantable brand-new chips can rapidly change the ignition frequency. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This TPS strengthens the speed-up performance by 5%
		</p>
		<p>
		Makes combustion more completely, enhances fuel efficiency and reduces fuel consumption. For each start-up and speed-up
		</p>
		<p>
		The vigorous 12 horsepower can be triggered in a flash.
